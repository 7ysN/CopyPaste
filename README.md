# CopyPaste

**Main Usage:** 

In cases where it is not possible to copy and paste using `CTRL+V`, you can use this program instead.

## Usage:
**1. In the large upper window, paste the `Text` to transfer.**

**2. In the small window below, you need to set the `Timer` before the copy operation.**

**3. Then, press `Paste` click on the second screen and wait for the text to be copied.**
